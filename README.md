### A place for all of my Medium project coding

# Introduction
This document serves to inform the reader of what they should expect to be in the Repo. 

This repo will be filled with the Jupyter Notebooks I use to run the analysis I include in my Medium stories. 
I want to avoid filling my Medium up with super technical information (ie. blocks of code) because I want to
increase my applicable audience.
